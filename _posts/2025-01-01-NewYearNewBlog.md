# New Year, New Blog
Who dis?

## Purpose
Well, it's a new year and I wanted somewhere I could post stuff I'm working on and then be able to link to share with people.  Sometimes words don't do it justice and a well-organized post with pictures would be better.
Much easier than scrolling through my phone for an image and then realizing "Oh, that's on my old phone..." after hyping someone up. 

Also, screw instagram. Yeah, I said it. 

However, this post is for testing out Jekyll and this theme, documenting how I should use this theme, and updating it as I will inevitably forget. So, self, here you go: [Chirpy: New Post](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/).


## First-time Setup
If somehow you find yourself here and want a blog like this. It's super easy. Just follow this guide: [Chirpy: Getting Started](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/). I wanted something so simple that I didn't need to compile, build, or do anything.
I literally wanted to be able to blog and post straight from github.com. I'm using the GitHub editor right now to write this in Markdown. I've tried starting/maintaining a blog a few times now and always kill it because the maintenance,
while minimal, was uninteresting and a waste of time. This seems simple and capable of being done 100% in GitHub, for now. 

## Contact me
In the bottom left, you should be able to contact me via X.com or email once I generate an email alias for this site. It's late right now and I'm lazy.
